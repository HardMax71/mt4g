# mt4g -- Memory Topology for GPUs

This project tries to capture the memory topology of Nvidia & AMD GPUs, 
specifically all GPUs since the Kepler (Nvidia) and GCN 5.0 (AMD) 
microarchitectures.



## Pre-requisites & Compatibility

- `cmake 3.22` or higher
  - Was also tested on `cmake 3.10`, works correctly.
- For Nvidia: `nvcc 11.0` or higher (tested on 11.4, 11.6 & 11.7)
  - `nvcc 12.x` is not supported, as some HIP-libraries use older CUDA Texture API, removed in 12.x
  - Tested on Nvidia Kepler, Maxwell, Pascal, Volta, Turing, Ampere GPUs.
- For AMD: `hip-clang 15` or higher (tested on 15.0, 16.0)
  - Tested on AMD GCN 4.0, RDNA 1, CDNA 1, CDNA 2 microarchitectures.
- Primarilly developed for Linux.

## Installation

Cmake is the primary means for installing mt4g.

```bash
# pull latest version of cuda-samples git submodule
git submodule update --init

# build and install the benchmarking executable for a specific microarchitecture
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
# build options:
# -DIsDebug=1                           - turns on debug output
# -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../inst-dir    - to install locally into the git repo folder
make all install
```
## Running the Benchmarks

Run the benchmarsk with

```cmake
../inst-dir/mt4g
# options:
#   -p:<path>:
#   	Overwrites the source of information for the number of Cuda Cores
# 	<path> specifies the path to the directory, that contains the 'deviceQuery' executable
#   -p: Overwrites the source of information for the number of Cuda Cores, uses 'nvidia-settings'
#   -d:<id> Sets the device, that will be benchmarked
#   -l1: Turns on benchmark for l1 data cache
#   -l2: Turns on benchmark for l2 data cache
#   -txt: Turns on benchmark for texture cache
#   -ro: Turns on benchmark for read-only cache
#   -c: Turns on benchmark for constant cache
```
If multiple GPUs are installed, you need to compile to the correct compute capability and then specify the device ID with the flag -d:
- `./mt4g -d:1` executes the tool using the GPU with deviceID 1
  You can obtain the device ID again by calling `nvidia-smi` and checking the _GPU_ flag.

When the benchmarks are over (usually in 5-15 min), the final output is 
stored in `GPU_Memory_Topology.csv`.

## Known issues/limitations

Nvidia: 
- For `Pascal` microarchitecture, the process may evaluate L1 cache 
as not present (output in stdout `[L1_L2_DIFF.H]: Compare average values: L1 242.530000 <<>> L2 242.560000, compute absolute distance: 0.030000", where the L1 and L2 values are very similar) -- try building mt4g with a makefile instead (make)`.
- On `Volta` and `Ampere`, the L1/Texture/Readonly cache size is measured about 6â€“8 KiB less than the actual value (32 KiB).

AMD:
- `HIP`-tools may detect the compiler incorrectly, thus setting Nvidia and/or None as target. To fix,
set `HIP_PLATFORM` as `export HIP_PLATFORM=hcc`. [More info](https://sep5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Programming_Guides/HIP-FAQ.html)
- Sometimes `CMake` can't find `FindHIP.cmake` (like [here](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP-CPU/issues/7)), thus resulting in fail during build stage. 
In this case, check if installed `hip-config` tool works and produces correct results (platform, compiler, available flags).
  - If it works but `CMake` can't still find `HIP`, compile from console as follows:
```bash
# compile support tool for capturing constant caches
hipcc starter_other/ConstMemory.cpp -o c15 -lstdc++fs

# compile main tool (that uses the support tool)
hipcc capture.cpp -o mt4g -lstdc++fs

# start executing tests
./mt4g
```

## About

mt4g has been initially created by Dominik Groessler (ge69qux@mytum.de),
extended to AMD by Maksym Azatian (ge35yaj@mytum.de),
and the [CAPS TUM](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/caps/homepage/), 
and is further maintained by Stepan Vanecek (stepan.vanecek@tum.de) and the CAPS TUM.

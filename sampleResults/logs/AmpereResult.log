Usage: ./MemTop [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS
=============================================

-p:<path>: 
	Overwrites the source of information for the number of Cuda Cores
	<path> specifies the path to the directory, that contains the 'deviceQuery' executable
-p: Overwrites the source of information for the number of Cuda Cores, uses 'nvidia-settings'
-d:<id> Sets the device, that will be benchmarked
-l1: Turns on benchmark for l1 data cache
-l2: Turns on benchmark for l2 data cache
-txt: Turns on benchmark for texture cache
-ro: Turns on benchmark for read-only cache
-c: Turns on benchmark for constant cache

If none of the benchmark switches is used, every benchmark is executed!
Will execute All Checks
Using helper_cuda option for number of cores


Measure if L1 is used for caching global loads
